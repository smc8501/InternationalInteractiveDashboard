How to work in GitHub as a Team:
* In your terminal execute the following command `git clone [https url of the repository in GitHub]`
* Now you have the project on your local repository.
* Create a branch with the name of the ticket in Trello by executing this command `git branch [branch-name]`
* Once you have finished doing the code, execute the following command `git add [filename or .]` Note that `.` means that you want to stage all the changes to the repository whereas if you instead include the filename git will only stage the changes made to that file.
* Now execute `git commit -m "[meaningful message about the work you have done]" '[filename]'`
* Then to put all the changes to the remote repository in GitHub execute `git push [branch name]`
* Once you have done this, please reach out to the team so that everyone's local repository is up to date by executing `git pull`.
